Blackjack: The aim of the game is to reach a higher card total than the opponent without exceeding 21. Hit is to draw a new card and add it to your cards. Fold is to stop drawing cards and stay with your current total. If your total exceeds 21, you have a bust. 
If a player has a bust, then the opponent wins if the opponent does not have a bust. If neither of the players have a bust, the player with higher card total wins. If both of them have bust or have same card total, there is no result
